A text-based escape game by Sean McPherson

## Foreward
Two weeks ago, you received an invitation to a *Night Sky* Party from your friend. The event was to take place at a "dark site" that was just a two-hour drive from the city. "The view of the night sky will be amazing beyond the city lights," she said.

You agreed to attend, although the idea of driving two hours after work on a Friday was not your first idea of a good time. Still, carpooling might be fun and it would be a good opportunity to reconnect with her and some of your mutual friends that you had recently fallen away from.

The day of the party, you received news at work that an accelerated deadline would require you to work late. Texting the group, you try to graciously back-out of the obligation, but your friend quickly responded with:

> "You can come late! I really wanted to see you."

Not one to leave a woman waiting, you agreed. As soon as work wraps up in the evening, you left the office and began the two-hour drive.

Traffic slowed your progress, but the bigger concern was the weather. Storm clouds blew in from the coast, thundering on the roof of your car and covering the roads. Your progress slowed to a crawl as the poor wiper blades labored to keep the windshield clear.
